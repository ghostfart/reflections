What happens when initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the structure of a repository, but nothing is commited to it. You do it to create a structure on which to build things, and you might not want to include all files in the directory. 

How is the staging area differrent from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a halfway house, to clearly markout what you want to track, and what you don't want to track.
